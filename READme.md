# Portfolio

This is my first website. It contains an HTML and a CSS file. I built it as an example to display various projects


## Installation

Users can follow this link to access the portfolio: https://jeremiahejensen04.github.io/My_Portfolio/


## Usage
The navigation bar in the top right will direct the user to various sections of the webpage. I provided a link to my first project under the projects list, the rest are for example only. My contact info is at the bottom
